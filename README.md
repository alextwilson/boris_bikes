## Boris Bikes

My first project at Makers Academy. A program simulating London's bicycle hire scheme.

### Approach

### Getting Started

### Testing

### User Stories

```
As a person,
So that I can use a bike,
I'd like a docking station to release a bike.

As a person,
So that I can use a good bike,
I'd like to see if a bike is working

As a member of the public,
So that I reduce the chance of getting a broken bike in future,
I'd like to be able to return broken bikes and report them as broken

As a maintainer of the system,
So that I can manage broken bikes and not disappoint users,
I'd like docking stations not to release broken bikes.

As a maintainer of the system,
So that I can control the distribution of bikes,
I'd like docking stations not to accept more bikes than their capacity.

As a system maintainer,
So that busy areas can be served more effectively,
I want to be able to specify a larger capacity when necessary.
